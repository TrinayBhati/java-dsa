//Problem 2: Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result
// must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.
//Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
//Output: [2,2]
//Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
//Output: [4,9] or [9,4]
